Hi, I'm Daniel. 

In the past I've worked as developer, consultant and evangelist and experienced my fair share of the good, the bad and the ugly in software development. Right now I'm with Microsoft supporting customers with DevOps, cloud native technologies and container stuff. And [right here](http://danielmeixner.github.io) is the place where I'm blogging on techstuff & coding. 

Enjoy!
